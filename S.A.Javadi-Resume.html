<p>TECHNICAL AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

<p>– Current project: Dynamic, interference-aware load balancing for cloud-deployed applications: Performance interference is one
of the main challenges in multi-tenant clouds especially for dynamic web workloads that have stringent performance require-
ments. We have been working on novel load balancers that can automatically detect interference and re-balance workload in an
interference-aware manner. Importantly, the load balancer will spin up new Virtual Machines (VMs), as needed, to handle severe
interference without violating performance requirements. The current tasks are: running Cloudsuite benchmark; creating CPU,
cache, memory, disk and network I/O load in the co-hosted VMs; modeling the application response time with interference;
extending load balancing algorithm and proposing new scale out mechanism by considering interference. We will next extend
Spark scheduler to take interference into account.
</p>
<p>– User-centric detection and estimation of performance interference: We designed a performance model, based on queueing
theory and machine learning, to detect and estimate the amount of interference in multi-tenant clouds. The model allows users
to estimate the true resources allocated to their application at any given time, without any assistance from the cloud provider
or hypervisor. Our experimental evaluation results on an OpenStack cluster show that the proposed approach can estimate
interference with less than 10% error for two popular cloud applications: (i) Apache web servers, and (ii) YARN.
