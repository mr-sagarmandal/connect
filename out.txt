We have been working on novel load balancers that can automatically detect interference and re-balance workload in an interference-aware manner. Importantly, the load balancer will spin up new Virtual Machines (VMs), as needed, to handle severe interference without violating performance requirements. The current tasks are: running Cloudsuite benchmark; creating CPU, cache, memory, disk and network I\/O load in the co-hosted VMs; modeling the application response time with interference; extending load balancing algorithm and proposing new scale out mechanism by considering interference. We will next extend Spark scheduler to take interference into account.\n\n\u2013 User-centric detection and estimation of performance interference: We designed a performance model, based on queueing theory and machine learning, to detect and estimate the amount of interference in multi-tenant clouds. The model allows users to estimate the true resources allocated to their application at any given time, without any assistance from the cloud provider or hypervisor. Our experimental evaluation results on an OpenStack cluster show that the proposed approach can estimate interference with less than 10% error for two popular cloud applications: (i) Apache web servers, and (ii) YARN.\n\n\u2022 R&D Employee, Sharif University of Technology, April 2011 - August 2013 \u2013 Design and implementation of transparent data encryption for PostgreSQL \u2013 Design and implementation of a label based access control model for PostgreSQL\n\n"},{"PUBLICATIONS":" \u2022 Dynamic Interference-Aware Load Balancing, S.
